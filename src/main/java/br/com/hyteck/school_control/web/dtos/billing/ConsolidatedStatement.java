/**
 * Represents a consolidated financial statement for a responsible party for a specific reference month.
 * This record is designed to be immutable. It aggregates multiple individual invoice items
 * into a single statement with a total amount due and an overall due date.
 *
 * Note on list immutability: While records provide shallow immutability, the {@code items} list,
 * if mutable, could be modified externally after the record's creation. To ensure deep
 * immutability, consider using {@code List.copyOf(items)} in a compact constructor or ensuring
 * that an immutable list is passed during instantiation.
 *
 * @param responsibleId    The unique identifier of the responsible party.
 * @param responsibleName  The name of the responsible party.
 * @param referenceMonth   The year and month to which this consolidated statement pertains.
 * @param totalAmountDue   The total sum of all individual invoice items included in this statement.
 * @param overallDueDate   The single due date for the payment of the total amount.
 * @param items            A list of {@link StatementLineItem} objects, detailing individual charges or invoices.
 * @param paymentLink      An optional URL or link that directs the user to a payment gateway for this statement.
 * @param barcode          An optional barcode string, typically for generating a printable bill (boleto in Brazil).
